Make my ecommerce website fully functional, visually smooth, and production-ready. The goal is to create a complete shopping experience where users can sign up or log in securely, browse and view products with a clean and modern UI, add items to their cart, update or remove them, and proceed to checkout to make payments using Razorpay. After a successful payment, users should see a confirmation page, view their past orders, and be able to request returns or refunds through Razorpay’s refund API. The authentication system should be secure, using either JWT or session-based login, and all admin routes like /admin/login must be protected from public access. The product and cart system should show product details like name, price, image, and description, and store cart data for logged-in users, with a simple cookie-based cart for guests. Razorpay integration must include backend order creation, payment verification using webhooks or callbacks, and saving all order and payment details in the database using the environment variables RZP_KEY_ID and RZP_KEY_SECRET, which I will provide. After payment, the order confirmation page should display details clearly, and users should have access to a “My Orders” section with refund and return options. The site should also include standard policy pages — Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Refund Policy — along with success or error notifications for all major actions. The UI should look soft, balanced, and minimalistic, using clean fonts, modern spacing, subtle transitions, and mobile responsiveness to create a professional and calming experience similar to a real ecommerce website. Add one test product and a test user, and provide a step-by-step checklist to verify the full journey: signup → add to cart → checkout with Razorpay test keys → confirm payment → view order → request refund. Finally, update the README file with setup instructions, environment variables, Razorpay configuration details, and testing steps. If any credentials, API keys, or extra information are needed, list them clearly so I can provide them.
