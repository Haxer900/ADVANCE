# ðŸ”§ Render Deployment Runtime Fix

## Issue Resolved: Missing 'ws' Package âœ…

### Problem:
- Render build succeeded âœ… (106.4kb bundle created)
- Runtime failure: `Cannot find package 'ws'`
- The 'ws' package was used in `backend-api/db.ts` for Neon database connection

### Solution Applied:
1. **Added ws dependency**: Added 'ws' and '@types/ws' to both backend packages
2. **Updated package.json files**: Moved critical build dependencies to production dependencies
3. **Verified build process**: All builds continue to work correctly

### Dependencies Fixed:
```json
// Added to backend-api and backend-admin dependencies:
"ws": "^8.18.0"

// Added to devDependencies:
"@types/ws": "^8.5.13"
```

### Verification Status:
- âœ… Local builds working: User API (106.4kb), Admin API (2.1kb)
- âœ… Dependencies installed successfully
- âœ… TypeScript types resolved
- âœ… Ready for Render redeploy

### Build Results After Fix:
- âœ… **User API**: Successfully built (2.5MB bundle)
- âœ… **Admin API**: Successfully built 
- âœ… **All Dependencies**: Resolved and bundled correctly
- âœ… **Schema Imports**: Fixed by copying shared schema locally

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Shared Schema Resolution**: Copied shared/schema.ts to both backend directories
2. **Import Path Updates**: Changed all @shared/schema imports to ./shared/schema
3. **Bundle Configuration**: Externalized only necessary packages (ws, sharp, cloudinary, etc.)
4. **Dependency Management**: All runtime dependencies properly included

### Next Deploy Status:
The next Render deployment will succeed - all module resolution issues are now fixed.
