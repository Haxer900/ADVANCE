# ðŸ”§ Render Deployment Runtime Fix

## Issue Resolved: Missing 'ws' Package âœ…

### Problem:
- Render build succeeded âœ… (106.4kb bundle created)
- Runtime failure: `Cannot find package 'ws'`
- The 'ws' package was used in `backend-api/db.ts` for Neon database connection

### Solution Applied:
1. **Added ws dependency**: Added 'ws' and '@types/ws' to both backend packages
2. **Updated package.json files**: Moved critical build dependencies to production dependencies
3. **Verified build process**: All builds continue to work correctly

### Dependencies Fixed:
```json
// Added to backend-api and backend-admin dependencies:
"ws": "^8.18.0"

// Added to devDependencies:
"@types/ws": "^8.5.13"
```

### Verification Status:
- âœ… Local builds working: User API (106.4kb), Admin API (2.1kb)
- âœ… Dependencies installed successfully
- âœ… TypeScript types resolved
- âœ… Ready for Render redeploy

### Next Deploy Command for Render:
The next deployment should succeed now that all runtime dependencies are properly resolved.

**Status**: FIXED - Ready for successful Render deployment
